# The premain loads the plugin directory configured under plugins, and the agentmain loads the active plugin directory under dynamicPlugins
# Plugins are loaded in the following order:
# 1. First load the default plugins in the order configured in 'plugins'.
# 2. Then load the list of scene plugins according to the scene order configured in 'profile'. The loading order of scene plugins is the same as that in the configuration file.
# 3. If the plugin configured in 'profiles' has been loaded before, it will not be loaded again.
# 4. Bytecode enhancements at the same intercept point for different plugins take effect in the same order as the plugins load.
# 'plugins' is used to configure static plugins. The plugins take effect when Sermant starts by premain. Plugins that support static installation are configured and cannot be uninstalled
